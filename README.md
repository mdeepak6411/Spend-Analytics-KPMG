# Capstone Project- Spend Analytics 

## Abstract:
In this project, i have analyzed and classified the spend data for 
the procurement function of a company. That will enable the 
company to identify the scope for efficiency improvement and 
better strategic planning.


## Market Outlook:
In todayâ€™s digitalized world procurement has become the most important tool 
to harness the power of data and draw intelligent insights to achieve and 
optimize overall performance for an organization. Leading organizations 
across the globe have pulled various discussions in order to align procurement 
strategies with the enterprise. As procurement moves from being a support 
function to playing a strategic role, many believe in using predictive and 
descriptive analytics in order to generate more business value. Data Science 
and Data Visualization have proven effective in streamlining processes and 
improved decision making. 
With the emergence of new function-oriented concepts such as spend analytics 
and contract analytics; organizations have been able to identify areas where 
cost can be saved. These concepts have been known for providing a 
recurring spend visibility which can be the future driving force for a long-term 
cost optimization strategy.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion based on our analysis we can see that the data belongs to a poultry company
owing to products like feeds, maize, soya bean and poultry specific vaccines.
We have seen a very high number of purchase orders and requesters for the same products. 
Additionally, we have observed the weekly ordering of higher quantities of top products.

Hence, we recommend consolidation of POs and requesters to enable cost saving through bulk purchases. 
This in turn can eliminate redundancies and help optimise the procurement process.

On further examination i have discovered that the highest quantities were ordered on Tuesdays 
which went hand in hand with high rebate basis on Tuesdays. 
Thus, we can conclude that higher cost savings can be achieved by ordering on Tuesdays as 
opposed to the other weekdays or weekends.
