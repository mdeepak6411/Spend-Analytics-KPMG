# Market Outlook
In todayâ€™s digitalized world procurement has become the most important tool 
to harness the power of data and draw intelligent insights to achieve and 
optimize overall performance for an organization. Leading organizations 
across the globe have pulled various discussions in order to align procurement 
strategies with the enterprise. As procurement moves from being a support 
function to playing a strategic role, many believe in using predictive and 
descriptive analytics in order to generate more business value. Data Science 
and Data Visualization have proven effective in streamlining processes and 
improved decision making. 
With the emergence of new function-oriented concepts such as spend analytics 
and contract analytics; organizations have been able to identify areas where 
cost can be saved. These concepts have been known for providing a 
recurring spend visibility which can be the future driving force for a long-term 
cost optimization strategy.
